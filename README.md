# Healthcare Cost Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare costs using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. By leveraging tools like Databricks, Spark, and BI visualization platforms, the goal is to uncover cost patterns, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights for managing healthcare expenses.

## Key Features
1. **Data Analysis**: Explore healthcare costs based on demographics, treatments, and diagnoses using Spark and SQL.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate regression models to estimate healthcare costs based on patient profiles and medical history.
3. **Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards in Power BI or Tableau to highlight cost trends and high-cost drivers.
4. **High-Cost Driver Analysis**: Identify factors significantly impacting healthcare expenses and suggest optimization strategies.
5. **Clustering and Personalization**: Segment patients for tailored care plans using clustering techniques.
6. **Time-Series Forecasting**: Predict future healthcare cost trends using aggregated time-series data.

## Technologies Used
- **Databricks & Apache Spark**: For data ingestion, processing, and modeling.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: For interactive and insightful dashboards.
- **Machine Learning**: Spark MLlib for regression and clustering models.
